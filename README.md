## Project Overview

As the lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, I was tasked with building a set of data reports to answer critical questions about the program's utilization. The goal was to provide valuable insights to city officials for program improvement and publicity.

## Data Exploration and Phenomena

### Total Trips Recorded
- Explored the dataset to determine the total number of recorded trips during the chosen period.

### Ridership Growth
- Calculated the percentage increase in total ridership over the selected time frame.

### Customer Type Changes
- Analyzed how the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed over time.

### Peak Hour Analysis (Summer vs. Winter)
- Identified the peak hours during summer and winter months when bikes were most frequently used.

### Station Analysis
- Investigated the top and bottom 10 stations for both starting and ending journeys. Provided hypotheses based on the data.

### Gender Breakdown
- Conducted an analysis of the gender breakdown of active participants (Male vs. Female).

### Gender Outreach Effectiveness
- Evaluated the effectiveness of gender outreach efforts in increasing female ridership.

### Trip Duration by Age
- Explored how average trip duration varied by age group.

### Average Distance Covered
- Calculated the average distance, in miles, that a bike was ridden.

### Bike Maintenance Recommendations
- Identified bikes (by ID) that were most likely due for repair or inspection based on usage patterns.

## Tableau Workbook Contents

- Created a Tableau Public workbook with 10 visualizations covering the phenomena mentioned above.
- Designed 2 dashboards for a comprehensive view of the data.
- Included a City Official Map for a geographic perspective of bike usage.
- Composed a Story to narrate the insights derived from the data.

## Conclusion and Insights

The analysis revealed valuable insights into the utilization patterns of the Citi Bike Program. The visualizations and dashboards provide a clear and comprehensive view of the program's performance, allowing for informed decision-making and targeted improvements.
